2. Design a model that takes in three images and predicts whether at least two of them belong to the same class or not.

## Dataset : 
The Imagenette dataset is a subset of 10 easily classified classes from the [Imagenet dataset](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette)https://github.com/fastai/imagenette.
